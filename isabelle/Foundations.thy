text \<open>In this chapter, the concepts that are relevant for the main part of this thesis will be introduced in text, as well as formalised in Isabelle. The formalisations of \cref{sec:LTS,sec:strong_bisimilarity} are based on those done by Benjamin Bisping in \cite{bisping2019computing} (the code is available on GitHub%
\footnote{see \code{\href{https://coupledsim.bbisping.de/code/}%
{coupledsim.bbisping.de/code/}}}%
).
All other formalisations were done as part of this thesis.\<close>

text \<open>In this section, the concepts that are relevant for the main part of this thesis will be introduced in text, as well as formalised in Isabelle. The formalisations of \cref{sec:LTS,sec:strong_bisimilarity} are based on those done by Benjamin Bisping in \cite{bisping2018computing}; the code is available on GitHub.%
\footnote{see \code{\href{https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/mtv/coupled-similarity}{gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/mtv/coupled-similarity}}}
All other formalisations were done as part of this thesis.\<close>
